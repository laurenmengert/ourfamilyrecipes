# Our Family Recipes

My mother is an amazing cook. So amazing that I have asked her several times to write down her recipes in a cook book but alas, here I sit, recipe-less! This app was developed with her in mind. I wanted to create an app that would allow everyone in my family (or any family) to share their family recipes! So please share, eat, and bon appetit!
